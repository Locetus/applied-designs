# Contributing Guidelines

Appreciate your valuable contribution and thanks in advance for your help!

Please go through these simple guidelines that would ease in getting acceptance to your new idea/work :+1:

## Planning to contribute

### When you propose a new feature or bug fix

**Note:** Please make sure to write an issue first and get enough feedback before jumping into a Pull Request!

- Please make sure there is an open issue discussing your contribution
- If there isn't, please open an issue so we can talk about it before you invest time into the implementation
- When creating an issue follow the guide that GitHub shows so we have enough information about your proposal

### When you want to work on an existing issue

**Note:** Please write a quick comment in the corresponding issue and ask if the feature is still relevant and that you want to jump into the implementation.

Check out our [help-wanted](https://github.com/Locetus/applied-designs/labels/status/help-wanted) or [easy-pick](https://github.com/Locetus/applied-designs/labels/status/easy-pick) labels to find issues we want to move forward on with your help.

We will do our best to respond/review/merge your PR according to priority. We hope that you stay engaged with us during this period to insure QA. Please note that the PR will be closed if there hasn't been any activity for a long time (~ 30 days) to keep us focused and keep the repo clean.

### Reviewing Pull Requests

Another really useful way to contribute to Applied-Designs is to review other peoples Pull Requests. Having feedback from multiple people is really helpful and reduces the overall time to make a final decision about the Pull Request.

## Writing / improving documentation

Our documentation lives on GitHub in the [docs](docs) directory. Do you see a typo or other ways to improve it? Feel free to edit it and submit a Pull Request!
